This repository holds Go code related to
[Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) (CT).  The
repository requires Go version 1.23.

## Repository Structure

The main parts of the repository are:

 - Encoding libraries:
   - `asn1/` and `x509/` are forks of the upstream Go `encoding/asn1` and
     `crypto/x509` libraries.  We maintain separate forks of these packages
     because CT is intended to act as an observatory of certificates across the
     ecosystem; as such, we need to be able to process somewhat-malformed
     certificates that the stricter upstream code would (correctly) reject.
     Our `x509` fork also includes code for working with the
     [pre-certificates defined in RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-3.1).
   - `tls` holds a library for processing TLS-encoded data as described in
     [RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246).
   - `x509util/` provides additional utilities for dealing with
     `x509.Certificate`s.
 - CT client libraries:
   - The top-level `ct` package (in `.`) holds types and utilities for working
     with CT data structures defined in
     [RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962).
   - `client/` and `jsonclient/` hold libraries that allow access to CT Logs
     via HTTP entrypoints described in
     [section 4 of RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-4).
   - `dnsclient/` has a library that allows access to CT Logs over
     [DNS](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-rfcs/blob/master/dns/draft-ct-over-dns.md).
   - `scanner/` holds a library for scanning the entire contents of an existing
     CT Log.
 - CT Personality for [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian):
    - `trillian/` holds code that allows a Certificate Transparency Log to be
      run using a Trillian Log as its back-end -- see
      [below](#trillian-ct-personality).
 - Command line tools:
   - `./client/ctclient` allows interaction with a CT Log.
   - `./ctutil/sctcheck` allows SCTs (signed certificate timestamps) from a CT
     Log to be verified.
   - `./scanner/scanlog` allows an existing CT Log to be scanned for certificates
      of interest; please be polite when running this tool against a Log.
   - `./x509util/certcheck` allows display and verification of certificates
   - `./x509util/crlcheck` allows display and verification of certificate
     revocation lists (CRLs).
 - Other libraries related to CT:
   - `ctutil/` holds utility functions for validating and verifying CT data
     structures.
   - `loglist3/` has a library for reading
     [v3 JSON lists of CT Logs](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/ct-policy/c/IdbrdAcDQto/m/i5KPyzYwBAAJ).


## Trillian CT Personality

The `trillian/` subdirectory holds code and scripts for running a CT Log based
on the [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian) general transparency Log,
and is [documented separately](trillian/README.md).


## Working on the Code

Developers who want to make changes to the codebase need some additional
dependencies and tools, described in the following sections.

### Running Codebase Checks

The [`scripts/presubmit.sh`](scripts/presubmit.sh) script runs various tools
and tests over the codebase; please ensure this script passes before sending
pull requests for review.

```bash
# Install golangci-lint
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@v1.61.0

# Run code generation, build, test and linters
./scripts/presubmit.sh

# Run build, test and linters but skip code generation
./scripts/presubmit.sh  --no-generate

# Or just run the linters alone:
golangci-lint run
```

### Rebuilding Generated Code

Some of the CT Go code is autogenerated from other files:

- [Protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) message
  definitions are converted to `.pb.go` implementations.
- A mock implementation of the Trillian gRPC API (in `trillian/mockclient`) is
  created with [GoMock](https://github.com/golang/mock).
- Some enums have string-conversion methods (satisfying the `fmt.Stringer`
   interface) created using the
   [stringer](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer) tool (`go get
   golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer`).

Re-generating mock or protobuffer files is only needed if you're changing
the original files. The recommended way to do this is by using the Docker
image used by the Cloud Build:

```shell
docker build -f ./integration/cloudbuild/testbase/Dockerfile -t ctgo-builder .
docker run -it --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/src ctgo-builder /bin/bash -c "cd /src; ./scripts/install_deps.sh; go generate -x ./..."
```

These commands first create a docker image from the Dockerfile in this repo, and
then launch a container based on this image with the local directory mounted. The
correct versions of the tools are determined using the `go.mod` file in this repo,
and these tools are installed. Finally, all of the generated files are regenerated
and Docker exits.

Alternatively, you can install the prerequisites locally:

  - a series of tools, using `go install` to ensure that the versions are
    compatible and tested:

    ```
    cd $(go list -f '{{ .Dir }}' github.com/google/trillian); \
    go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen; \
    go install google.golang.org/protobuf/proto; \
    go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v.1.34.1; \
    go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc; \
    go install github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/cmd/protoc-gen-doc; \
    go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
    ```
  - `protoc` tool: you'll need [version 3.20.1](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.20.1) installed, and `PATH` updated to include its `bin/` directory.

and run the following:

```bash
go generate -x ./...  # hunts for //go:generate comments and runs them
```
